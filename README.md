# README

This repository contains working code and raw data supporting the paper:

**“Revisiting the tensionless limit of pure–Ramond–Ramond AdS3/CFT2”**
A. Brollo, D. le Plat, A. Sfondrini.

## Contents

### DataLists.nb

The file `DataLists.nb` collects all numerical data in appropriately structured *Mathematica* lists.
The values are reported up to their estimated precision of (10^{-9}), as discussed in Appendix A of the paper.

### codes/

The `codes` directory is organized according to the value of (M), following the notation of the paper:

* `M=1/`: two-particle excitations
* `M=2/`: four-particle excitations

Each subdirectory contains fully commented and working code used in the analysis.

### data/

The `data` directories contains the output of the numerical runs, stored as `.npy` files.
